# Useful Tenets in Purpose to Action Framework

A tenet is a principle or belief.  P2AF does not attempt to prove these tenets, but instead holds them as true as they are shown to be useful.  The following tenets are held to be true in P2AF.

### Individuals make decisions, groups do not.

The idea that a group of people can make a decision is a fallacy.  Only individuals can make decisions.  Likewise, because only individuals can be responsible for themselves and their actions, only individuals can be accountable.

It can be useful to take input from others before making a decision, but the idea that "we will make that decision as a group" is a lie.

### Work happens through Roles.

Any action we perform can be thought of as being performed in a role.  (You could say we perform work *in roles*, or *as roles* or *through roles* - all have the same meaning.)  Depending on the role you're in, and the role you're talking to, you may have different expectations.  For example, if you're talking to your life partner in a "Finance" role, you will probably behave differently than if you're talking to them in a *Lover* role.  Getting clear about the role you're speaking as, and the role you're speaking to helps create clarity.

### Organizations can't govern people.

We think of our organizations as being made of people, but in reality organizations are made of Roles.  When someone takes a new job, they are agreeing to follow certain rules that are set by the organization.  Those rules govern the behaviour of *Roles*, or *People when in roles* of the organization.  An organization can't govern a person's behaviour outside of the roles the person fills in the organization.  For example, if you went to work for someone and they said "You cannot eat meat ever, even in private, if you are going to work for us", they would be attempting to govern you as a person, not governing a role.

### If it isn't written down, you can't expect it.

One of the things that clouds clarity in organizations is the notion of "Implicit Expectations." By making expectations explicit, we can get clear about what we can count on others for, and what we can be counted on.  We can also change those expectations and be objective about if we are meeting those expectations or not.  Having explicit expectations creates psychological safety, which is the #1 trait observed in high-performing teams according to Google's Project Arestotle, a research project created to identify what makes a good team.

If someone asks you do so something, you can tell if it makes sense to do by checking the explicit accountabilities of your roles.  If it isn't written down, you can answer "You have no right to expect it" which is a great way to be clear that the expectation is not explicit.  Once an implicit expectation is identified, it can be written down.  Writing down explicit expectations of roles is called governance.

### There are three ways to work

Aka "Three levels of Action"

All behaviours described in P2AF fall into one of three categories:
- Work with yourself (Individual)
- Work with another (Pair)
- With with a group (Group)

#### Work with yourself (Individual)
Things you do alone on behalf of the organization.  Examples include sending an invoice, reviewing your projects, checking your work email.

#### Work with another (Pair)
Things you do with one other person.  Examples include requesting someone do something, asking a question, or sharing information.

#### Work with a Group (Group)
Things you do that require a group of people.  (In some cases, a group can be two people.)  This includes all the examples from "Pair", but anyone in the group can ask or answer.  Tactical Meetings are the best examples of group actions.


## Conditions

Working with a group using Purpose To Action framework requires your agreement with the following conditions.  These conditions are broken into two groups, as some conditions require more development than others.

#### If you have to do it more than once, you must write it down.

If it isn't written down, you can't expect it.  Therefore, if you do something that isn't written down more than once, you are doing something unexpected for the organization.  When you write down the things you do more than once, you create organizational learning.  By not writing these things down, you are robbing the organiazation of learning and reducing its capacity to express its purpose in the long term.  For example, if you have a Role called "Finance" and you take a payment from someone, but there's no accountability on the Finance role for taking payments, you should add an accountability to the role that explains that you do this on an ongoing basis.  The accountabiltiy can be as simple as "Accepting payments from customers".  Now, the next time you accept a payment, you are doing something that is expected of the role.

(In Holacracy, the condition "If you have to do it more than once, you must write down" is described according to the rules of Individual Initiative.)

#### Keep your agreements and ask for new ones.

It goes without saying that breaking agreements undermines teamwork.  So, one of the conditions of working together is keeping your agreements whenever possible.  In addition, when you notice something that would be useful, you should ask for new agreements.  These new agreements almost always take the form of accountabilities on a role.  For example, if you noticed that every time you asked the Finance role to send an invoice, it took them three weeks, and your customers were getting confused, you could ask for a new agreement from the Finance role for "paying invoices in a timely fashion."  Once this agreement is in place, you can expect the Finance role to do that on an ongoing basis.  These ongoing expectations of Roles are called Accountabilities.  (Asking for new agreements from roles can also be thought of as *"Telling the organization what you think it needs"*)

#### Keep three lists

To have a functioning team, it is important that every team member agree to keep three different lists:

##### **List of Projects & Next Actions**
This is a list of every project you're working on for the organization, along with the Role you're doing it as, and the next action you plan to take when you have time to work on the project.  Keeping a list of projects and next actions may sound easy, but picking the best next action can be hard.

##### Agendas & Topics
This is a list of people and groups you want to bring things up with.  Each Agenda & Topic has the person or group (team, circle) that you need something from, along with the name of the thing you want to discuss.  The name of the thing is the Topic.  The Agenda is the list of topics.  Agendas are usually named after the person or team you want to bring the topic up with.  The feeling behind the topic is a Concern, sometimes called a Tension.  Each person keeps a list of Agendas and Topics so they can bring up their concerns when they are in the right place.

(In Holacracy, Topics are referred to as Agenda Items and Concerns are referred to as Tensions.  In Getting Things Done, the place you bring up your topic is called a Context.)

##### Concerns (Tensions)
This is a list of every idea you have about how to make something better in the organization.  Concerns generally relate to your roles.  If you have a concern that relates to a role that you don't fill, you can share the concern with that role, but unless they feel the same way (unless they "resonate" with the concern,) they don't have to do anything about that concern, and you can remove it from your list.  Every concern that you have can be resolved by taking concrete actions or bringing the concern up with someone else.

#### Four Responsabilities

Doing work in the organization depends on you agreeing to the following four things:

##### Review your lists

You must regularly review your three lists and keep them up to date.  This is necessary so that you have an accurate view of the world.  As part of reviewing your lists, you should have at least some idea of what the next action is for any project.  If you have concerns that aren't written down, when reviewing your lists you should add them to your list of concerns.  If you know who can help you with the concern, add a topic describing it to your list of agendas.

In Getting Things Done, reviewing your lists is called the GTD Weekly Review.

##### Prioritize your work & Work on your priorities

You must organize your work according to what you think will serve the organization best.  Then, when doing work, you must pick the work that you think will serve the organization best.  If someone asks you about a project, you need to be able to tell them what other work is higher priority to you than that project.  If someone asks when you think something will be done, you must give them a general idea of when you think it will be done given all your other priorities.  This estimate is called a "projection", and projections are not binding.  (This is because your priorities may change based on what's happening inside and outside the organization, so we assume that all projections are subject to change.)

##### Consider requests and accept them if they make sense

When someone asks you to do something, you must consider a few things before agreeing to do it.  This request usually takes the form of a asking you do so something in the world, either as a Project or Action.

Before accepting a request for a project or action, first consider if the request makes sense to do for any of your roles.  Then consider if it makes sense to do on behalf of the teams (also known as circles) that your roles belong to.  Then consider if it makes sense to do for the organization overall.  If it makes sense to your Role, you should accept the request.  If it makes sense to your Circle or the organization overall, you can choose to accept it or not based on your judgement.

If a project request makes sense to your role, you must accept it no matter how busy you are.  You must accept the request even if you know you'll never get to it.  Remember, you are responsible for prioritizing your work based on what you think is most important to the organization, so you get to decide if that project will get attention.  That way, the request is at least with the role that can do something about it.

If you accept a project that makes sense to the organization but you don't have a Role for it, then you must write down that concern and eventually work toward resolving it by making it an explicit expectation.  This is done by updating or creating a Role in the appropriate Circle.  The way you update or create a role is different depending on the circle or organization's rules.  In some circles, you can create the role yourself.  In other circles, you can create the role but then you have to tell the leader of the circle (Circle Lead) that you made the change.  In still other circles, you must bring up the topic with the Circle Lead and let them make the change.  Or, if your circle is using Governance Meetings, you must take your topic to a Governance Meeting of the circle and propose the change there.

##### Do what you think is best unless someone made a rule against it

You have the authority to do whatever you think is best for the organization unless there's a rule against it. Those "rules against it" take the form of Domains and Policies.  You aren't allowed to spend money or dispose of assets, though.  If someone in another role thinks you action would cause harm, they can ask you to wait until they have a chance to make a rule against it.

It's good to state your intention to do things that you think might be problematic for another role, but don't let that stop you from taking action.  This is sometimes called a "Bias for Action".  Since other roles can set expectations of each other, they can put the appropriate rules in place to prevent you from causing harm as long as you give them time to do it.
