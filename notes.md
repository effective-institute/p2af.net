# Tenets
A tenet is a principle or belief.  P2AF does not attempt to prove these tenets, but instead holds them as true as they are shown to be useful.  The following tenets are held to be true in P2AF.

### Individuals make decisions, groups do not.

The idea that a group of people can make a decision is a fallacy.  Only individuals can make decisions.  Likewise, because only individuals can be responsible for themselves and their actions, only individuals can be accountable.

It can be useful to take input from others before making a decision, but the idea that "we will make that decision as a group" is a lie.

### Work happens through Roles.

Any action we perform can be thought of as being performed in a role.  (You could say we perform work *in roles*, or *as roles* or *through roles* - all have the same meaning.)  Depending on the role you're in, and the role you're talking to, you may have different expectations.  For example, if you're talking to your life partner in a "Finance" role, you will probably behave differently than if you're talking to them in a *Lover* role.  Getting clear about the role you're speaking as, and the role you're speaking to helps create clarity.

### Organizations can't govern people.

We think of our organizations as being made of people, but in reality organizations are made of Roles.  When someone takes a new job, they are agreeing to follow certain rules that are set by the organization.  Those rules govern the behaviour of *Roles*, or *People when in roles* of the organization.  An organization can't govern a person's behaviour outside of the roles the person fills in the organization.  For example, if you went to work for someone and they said "You cannot eat meat ever, even in private, if you are going to work for us", they would be attempting to govern you as a person, not governing a role.

### If it isn't written down, you can't expect it.

One of the things that clouds clarity in organizations is the notion of "Implicit Expectations." By making expectations explicit, we can get clear about what we can count on others for, and what we can be counted on.  We can also change those expectations and be objective about if we are meeting those expectations or not.  Having explicit expectations creates psychological safety, which is the #1 trait observed in high-performing teams according to Google's Project Arestotle, a research project created to identify what makes a good team.

If someone asks you do so something, you can tell if it makes sense to do by checking the explicit accountabilities of your roles.  If it isn't written down, you can answer "You have no right to expect it" which is a great way to be clear that the expectation is not explicit.  Once an implicit expectation is identified, it can be written down.  Writing down explicit expectations of roles is called governance.

### There are three ways to work

Aka "Three levels of Action"

All behaviours described in P2AF fall into one of three categories:
- Work with yourself (Individual)
- Work with another (Pair)
- With with a group (Group)

#### Work with yourself (Individual)
Things you do alone on behalf of the organization.  Examples include sending an invoice, reviewing your projects, checking your work email.

#### Work with another (Pair)
Things you do with one other person.  Examples include requesting someone do something, asking a question, or sharing information.

#### Work with a Group (Group)
Things you do that require a group of people.  (In some cases, a group can be two people.)  This includes all the examples from "Pair", but anyone in the group can ask or answer.  Tactical Meetings are the best examples of group actions.


## Conditions

Working with a group using Purpose To Action framework requires your agreement with the following conditions.  These conditions are broken into two groups, as some conditions require more development than others.

#### If you have to do it more than once, you must write it down.

If it isn't written down, you can't expect it.  Therefore, if you do something that isn't written down more than once, you are doing something unexpected for the organization.  When you write down the things you do more than once, you create organizational learning.  By not writing these things down, you are robbing the organiazation of learning and reducing its capacity to express its purpose in the long term.  For example, if you have a Role called "Finance" and you take a payment from someone, but there's no accountability on the Finance role for taking payments, you should add an accountability to the role that explains that you do this on an ongoing basis.  The accountabiltiy can be as simple as "Accepting payments from customers".  Now, the next time you accept a payment, you are doing something that is expected of the role.

(In Holacracy, the condition "If you have to do it more than once, you must write down" is described according to the rules of Individual Initiative.)

#### Keep your agreements and ask for new ones.

It goes without saying that breaking agreements undermines teamwork.  So, one of the conditions of working together is keeping your agreements whenever possible.  In addition, when you notice something that would be useful, you should ask for new agreements.  These new agreements almost always take the form of accountabilities on a role.  For example, if you noticed that every time you asked the Finance role to send an invoice, it took them three weeks, and your customers were getting confused, you could ask for a new agreement from the Finance role for "paying invoices in a timely fashion."  Once this agreement is in place, you can expect the Finance role to do that on an ongoing basis.  These ongoing expectations of Roles are called Accountabilities.  (Asking for new agreements from roles can also be thought of as *"Telling the organization what you think it needs"*)

#### Accountability

An ongoing expectation of a Role.  Accountabilities are written with a "gerund" verb, which mean action words have -ing on them.  For example, "Send invoice" is not a well-written accountability, but "Sending invoices" is.  Accountabilties should describe the ongoing action to perform, not how to perform it.  The more prescriptive an accountability is, the less freedom the person filling the role has to express it, which limits creativity, agility, and adpatability.


other conditions not well articulated:
If you break a rule, make a rule
If you help the org out of role, write it down
Tell the org wat you think it needs
